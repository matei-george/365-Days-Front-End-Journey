Creation of this repository organized in classic corporate Quarters. I've already written down my goals for January and hope I will achieve as much as I can of them. My goal is to achieve everything in that list, but given the fact that life always changes, I will be satisfied with a 80-90% completion grade.

I wish me and my beautiful girlfriend, Teo, the best and hope this year, 2023 will be a productive, lovely and insane year. :)

Didn't really code much. I picked a new theme for VSCode and resolve some issues regarding a CSS linkage to HMTL. I will start learning more from the CSS Udemy Course I bought tomorrow. Hope I will learn as much as I can. I also picked the materials I need for upcoming Uni projects that I really need to work on. 
Tried out a web hosting service for the first time. Doesn't seem like much, cuz has its own FTP service and didn't really need to use external software.
Hope I will master the 2 sections I set up this week. Will try my best to master CSS for as much as I can at the very least 1 hour/day.
My goal for this vacay week is to study it for 3-4 hours daily.
