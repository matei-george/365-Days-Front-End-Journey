Creation of this repository organized in classic corporate Quarters. I've already written down my goals for January and hope I will achieve as much as I can of them. My goal is to achieve everything in that list, but given the fact that life always changes, I will be satisfied with a 80-90% completion grade.

I wish me and my beautiful girlfriend, Teo, the best and hope this year, 2023 will be a productive, lovely and insane year. :)
